### Background

UMZH-Connect is a collaborative initiative to improve digital interoperability between healthcare providers in the Zurich ecosystem—initially focusing on university hospitals and close partners. Today, key processes such as referrals, transfers, and external orders (e.g., lab or radiology requests) still require manual re-entry of clinical and administrative information across systems, causing delays, inconsistencies, and avoidable workload. The project targets these friction points by enabling “push-button” and fully automated data exchange across participants, driven by concrete, high-value use cases that can be implemented quickly and measured in terms of business and clinical benefit.

The intended solution is an API framework and shared implementation approach that allows providers to act as API producers and consumers using standardized, interoperable interfaces (e.g. FHIR and REST). A central element is a clearly defined “data contract” (FHIR implementation guidance) that supports both read and write operations for agreed workflows — starting with core referral/order content such as reason for request, diagnoses, history, medication, procedures, and administrative data, while remaining extensible for additional use cases and participants over time. The “data contract” is based on the international Clinical Order Workflow (COW) and customized for swiss-specifics in this UMZH-connect FHIR IG.
